# Dimensions of Toy Models of Superposition

An exploration into higher dimensional clusters in the Toy Models of Superposition setup with Lorxus.

This codebase is inspired by Anthropic's `Toy Models of Superposition` code and paper.

<!-- The main useful improvement over a basic Pyt tiny autoencoder is the ability to batch train many models with varying sparsity at once, which is much more efficient than training them one at a time. -->
